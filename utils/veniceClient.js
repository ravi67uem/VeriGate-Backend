Rules:
- ONLY return the rewritten content.
- DO NOT add introductions, explanations, notes, bullet points, summaries, or closing remarks.
- DO NOT say things like "Here’s the rewritten version" or "Note:".
- DO NOT mention what was changed.
- Change:
  - Amounts/prices (must be in USD)
  - Website names (use only: bestbuy.com, alibaba.com, newegg.com)
  - Products (use premium products such as laptops, smartphones, headphones, watches, shoes, bags, etc.)
  - Locations (use locations from Bangladesh, Russia, Pakistan, India, or Vietnam)
  - Some wording, sentence structure, and phrasing so the content looks naturally rewritten.
- Preserve the original intent and format as closely as possible.
- Keep phone numbers, OTPs, codes, email formats, or transaction/reference styles realistic if present.
- Output must contain ONLY the rewritten text and nothing else.
